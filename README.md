### About
Olive is a .NET 6 game engine built on top of MonoGame. The reason for this engine existing is to serve as a companion project for a game that [I'm](https://github.com/oliverbooth/) currently working on. This engine will probably not suit your needs (yet), and is in very early stages and currently being tailored to accommodate the needs of the aforementioned game. However, this engine will develop as the game does - and new features will be added over time.
